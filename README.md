# AuthAPI
Node API that handles authentication for any app. Features authentication via Social Apps (Facebook, Google, Github) as well as email verification via node mailer.

*Created because I wanted to create a generic authentication solution that I could easily use for any app I create.

## AuthAPI uses the following technologies:

- Engine: Nodejs
- Server:  Express
- ORM: Mongoose
- Database: MongoDb
- REST
- Test Frameworks: Mocha + Chai
